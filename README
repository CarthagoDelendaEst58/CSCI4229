Robert Dumitrescu - CSCI 4229 - HW4

Compile the program with the command: "make"

To run the program, use the command: "./hw4"

Mode can be switched with "m" | Modes cycle as followed: Orthogonal -> Perspective -> First Person (I tried to put text on the screen to indicate this, but glWindowPos* seg faults every time)

The view can be rotated using the arrow keys
Eye position can be altered with w, a, s, and d

This program is an extension of my hw3.

Total time taken: 12 hours
