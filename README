Compile the program with the command: "make"

To run the program, use the command: "./hw3"

The view can be rotated using the arrow keys

This program was primarily built off of my hw2. The objects were created with the guidance of ex8.

There is an issue with the front wheels of the vehicle causing the inside surfaces to be rendered over the outside when viewed at certain angles.
I was not able to find a solution during the time I worked on this assignment unfortunately. Any suggestions regarding a fix would be appreciated.

Total time taken: ~9-10 hours
